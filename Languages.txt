What is your favorite programming language? Why?

Python is my favorite programming language. This is because of the readability and simplicity. Python's syntax is designed to be clear and readable, resembling natural language more than other programming languages. This makes it easier to write and understand code, especially for beginners which is what I was when I started college.
